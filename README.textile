h1. About

Bill is a programming language with a small grammar. It is designed as an experiment with LLVM compiling. Without going into too much detail, Bill uses the following concepts:
* Allow to rewrite/replace part of the program code at run-time using the "rewrite" statement.
* Gotos are allowed and even encouraged. Bill does not know the concept of "functions" or stack, if you need to call a routine you just use goto and are responsible for whatever this routine does to the memory once it's finished.
* Treat files like any other datatype: <pre>
<code>
file = <"origin.txt">
new_file = <"dest.txt">
new_file = file + file
</code>
</pre>
After execution, dest.txt will be overwritten with twice the content of file.
